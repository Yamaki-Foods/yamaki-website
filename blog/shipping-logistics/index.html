        <p>Logistics is a critical part of scaling any food brand, especially in the fast-evolving world of health foods. At Yamaki Foods, we understand that reliability, freshness, and shelf life make or break B2B relationships. That’s why we’ve designed our packaging, dispatch model, and partnerships to ensure our shirataki products stay fresh from our facility to your shelf.</p>

        <h3>⏰ Why Shelf Life Matters</h3>
        <p>Shirataki noodles and rice are moisture-based products that traditionally have a limited shelf life. However, with our proprietary packaging and aseptic filling methods, Yamaki extends the shelf life to a reliable 6 months at room temperature. This gives distributors, retailers, and export partners the breathing room needed for inventory rotation and cross-region logistics.</p>

        <h3>🚗 Our Shipping Process</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Dispatch in 48–72 Hours:</strong> All orders are processed quickly to reduce lag.</li>
          <li><strong>Pan-India Courier Network:</strong> We partner with top logistics providers for door delivery.</li>
          <li><strong>Bulk Pallet Shipments:</strong> For large orders, we offer truckload and cold-chain options.</li>
          <li><strong>GPS & Tracking Support:</strong> Ensure transparency for B2B clients.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>🛋️ Packaging That Protects</h3>
        <p>Our packaging is not only food-safe and leak-proof but also designed for retail display. Each unit includes full nutritional information, FSSAI compliance, and barcode placement to help retail operations run smoothly.</p>

        <p>We also provide bulk packaging for restaurants, clinics, and export buyers — including 1kg, 5kg, and 10kg pouch formats. All formats maintain freshness without refrigeration.</p>

        <h3>✅ Why Our Partners Trust Us</h3>
        <p>With partners across metro cities, Tier 2 towns, and export zones like Singapore and the Middle East, Yamaki Foods has earned a reputation for consistency. Our clients include health food stores, D2C brands, wellness chains, and nutritionists.</p>
