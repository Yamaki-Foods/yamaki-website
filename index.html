    <h2>What is Shirataki?</h2>
    <p>
      Shirataki is a traditional Japanese food made from the root of the konjac plant, also known as elephant yam. Its name means "white waterfall," referring to its translucent appearance. It’s composed almost entirely of water and glucomannan—a soluble dietary fiber known for its health benefits.
    </p>
    <p>
      With nearly zero calories and carbs, Shirataki has become a global superfood for people managing diabetes, following keto or gluten-free diets, or simply seeking a low-glycemic alternative to regular rice and noodles.
    </p>
    <p>
      What sets Shirataki apart is its ability to absorb the flavors of any dish while offering a uniquely satisfying texture. It promotes satiety, supports digestive health, and may aid in weight management due to its high fiber content.
    </p>
    <p>
      At <strong>Yamaki Foods</strong>, we source high-grade konjac and use a clean-label production process to ensure our Shirataki is odorless, quick to prepare, and versatile enough for traditional Indian meals, Asian stir-fries, soups, and modern fusion recipes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you're a home cook, fitness brand, or food service provider, Shirataki offers a sustainable, health-forward ingredient for the future of food.
